# ethereum-contract-inbox
This is my first ethereum blockchain based project . It's a simple contract allowing users to "Set New message" and "Get Message".


The old version i.e "inbox" is deployed at 0xA8C59AfB2E06089ED21771a38e58DD717970d819 on goerli test network.

The newer version i.e "inbox-updated" is deployed at 0x0DE4a4596691A6e3d409bE7006Baf5DDD26B10E2 on goerli test network.
